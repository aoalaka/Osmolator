# Osmolator
**---------**
The app name "osmolator" was coined from osmotic dehydration calculator. Osmotic dehydration was a core part of my MSc research at the university of Ibadan, Nigeria in 2018. It involves dissolution of salt, sugar or a mixture of solutes to form a solution of defined brix level inside which food samples such as fruits or vegetables can be immersed to be dehydrated and preserved and / or developed into new products. Calculating the amount of solute and water needed to make a solution of predefined brix level became repetitive, stressful and time-consuming for me whenever I was working in the lab. Hence, I developed this app to ease my task, ensure accuracy and shorten overall time for the experiment.
